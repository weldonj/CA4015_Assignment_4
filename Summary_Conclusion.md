## Summary



## Learning Outcomes

For all three of us, this was our first encounter with recommender systems and we definitely learned a great deal throughout the assignment. The Google tutorial, which we used as a reference point throughout the project, was hugely informative. It was very interesting to get an insight into the different techniques which form the basis of recommender systems, considering most of us implicitly interact with them every day. A central component of the project was figuring out how to represent the hugely skewed listening counts for each user and artist. Through exploring different normalisation techniques, we learned a great deal. We found that striking a balance between mitigating against the effect of said outliers while also preserving their raw occurrence throughout the data is a key part of managing them effectively and this is definitely something which we will all be more careful of in later projects.

Although we had all used the Tensorflow framework before, it definitely does take some getting used to. We learned a lot throughout the project about the different data structures and functionalities which TF has and more importantly, how to take advantage of these. As with the previous assignments, there is no doubt that many of us will encounter recommender systems in industry and the concepts and practical skills which we learned through battling with this assignment will definitely stand to us.
